# Region-Adder
Code for adding regions and other country information to csv files containing matching information such as country code.

The code itself is pretty easy to understand and adapt to any other application, future changes may include overwriting
the line or inserting in to selected lines. May add GUI but that's not important.

Change the names of the countries in the region_data.csv file to match your country. The code should provide you with
the lines that couldn't find a match, and provides the country name which didn't match.
